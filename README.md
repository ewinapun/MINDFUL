# MINDFUL: Measure Instabilities in Neural Data for Useful Long-term iBCI

<img src="/res/figure1.png" width=100% height=100%>

This repo contains code for reproduction of the main result described in the paper ["Measuring instability in multi-day human intracortical neural recordings towards stable, long-term brain-computer interfaces"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.02.29.582733v1).

You'll need to download the dataset to run the code.

Navigate over to `examples/` to run `MINDFUL_main_script.m`.

# Requirement

This code was written on MATLAB R2022b.
