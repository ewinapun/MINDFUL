# MINDFUL: measure instabilities in neural data for useful long-term iBCI

<img src="/res/figure1.png" width=50% height=50%>

This repo contains code for reproduction of the main result described in the paper ["Measuring instability in multi-day human intracortical neural recordings towards stable, long-term brain-computer interfaces"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.03.527022v1).

You'll need to download the dataset prior to run the code.
Navigate over to `examples/` to run MINDFUL_main_script.m.

# Requirement

This code runs on MATLAB R2022b or later.
